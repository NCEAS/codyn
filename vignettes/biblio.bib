abstract = {Stability in ecosystem function is an important but poorly understood phenomenon. Anthropogenic perturbations alter communities, but how they change stability and the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is not clear. We examined temporal stability (invariability) in aboveground productivity in replicated 18-year time series of experimentally perturbed grassland plant communities. We found that disturbed annual-dominated communities were more stable than undisturbed perennial communities, coincident with increases in the stabilizing effect of mean-variance scaling. We also found that nitrogen-fertilized communities maintained stability despite losses in species richness, probably because of increased compensatory dynamics and increased dominance by particularly stable dominant species. Among our communities, slight variation in diversity was not the strongest mechanism driving differences in stability. Instead, our study suggests that decreases in individual species variabilities and increases in the relative abundance of stable dominant species may help maintain stability in the functioning of ecosystems confronted with eutrophication, disturbance, and other global changes.},

	to achieve in a way that yields an intuitive picture of change. Rank
	clocks and rank abundance statistics provide a graphical and analytical
	framework for displaying and quantifying community dynamics. We used
	rank clocks, in which the rank order abundance for each species is
	plotted over time in temporal clockwise direction, to display temporal
	changes in species abundances and richness. We used mean rank shift
	and proportional species persistence to quantify changes in community
	structure in long-term data sets from fertilized and control plots
	in a late successional old field, frequently and infrequently burned
	tallgrass prairie, and Chihuahuan desert grassland and shrubland
	communities. Rank clocks showed that relatively constant species
	richness masks considerable temporal dynamics in relative species
	abundances. In the old field, fertilized plots initially experienced
	high mean rank shifts that stabilized rapidly below that of unfertilized
	plots. Rank shifts were higher in infrequently burned vs. annually
	burned tallgrass prairie and in desert grassland compared to shrubland
	vegetation. Proportional persistence showed that and grasslands were
	more dynamic than mesic grasslands. We conclude that rank clocks
	and rank abundance statistics provide important insights into community
	dynamics that are often hidden by traditional univariate approaches.}},

	abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity-productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive speicies would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better "coverage" of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity-invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},
