abstract = {Stability in ecosystem function is an important but poorly understood phenomenon. Anthropogenic perturbations alter communities, but how they change stability and the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is not clear. We examined temporal stability (invariability) in aboveground productivity in replicated 18-year time series of experimentally perturbed grassland plant communities. We found that disturbed annual-dominated communities were more stable than undisturbed perennial communities, coincident with increases in the stabilizing effect of mean-variance scaling. We also found that nitrogen-fertilized communities maintained stability despite losses in species richness, probably because of increased compensatory dynamics and increased dominance by particularly stable dominant species. Among our communities, slight variation in diversity was not the strongest mechanism driving differences in stability. Instead, our study suggests that decreases in individual species variabilities and increases in the relative abundance of stable dominant species may help maintain stability in the functioning of ecosystems confronted with eutrophication, disturbance, and other global changes.},

	to achieve in a way that yields an intuitive picture of change. Rank
	clocks and rank abundance statistics provide a graphical and analytical
	framework for displaying and quantifying community dynamics. We used
	rank clocks, in which the rank order abundance for each species is
	plotted over time in temporal clockwise direction, to display temporal
	changes in species abundances and richness. We used mean rank shift
	and proportional species persistence to quantify changes in community
	structure in long-term data sets from fertilized and control plots
	in a late successional old field, frequently and infrequently burned
	tallgrass prairie, and Chihuahuan desert grassland and shrubland
	communities. Rank clocks showed that relatively constant species
	richness masks considerable temporal dynamics in relative species
	abundances. In the old field, fertilized plots initially experienced
	high mean rank shifts that stabilized rapidly below that of unfertilized
	plots. Rank shifts were higher in infrequently burned vs. annually
	burned tallgrass prairie and in desert grassland compared to shrubland
	vegetation. Proportional persistence showed that and grasslands were
	more dynamic than mesic grasslands. We conclude that rank clocks

	abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity-productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive speicies would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better "coverage" of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity-invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

  abstract = {It is well known that ecological communities are spatially and temporally dynamic. Quantifying temporal variability in ecological communities is challenging, however, especially for time-series data sets of less than 40 measurement intervals. In this paper, we describe a method to quantify temporal variability in multispecies communities over time frames of 10-40 measurement intervals. Our approach is a community-level extension of autocorrelation analysis, but we use Euclidean distance to measure similarity of community samples at increasing time lags rather than the correlation coefficient. Regressing Euclidean distances versus increasing time lags yields a measure of the rate and nature of community change over time. We demonstrate the method with empirical data sets from shortgrass steppe, old-field succession and zooplankton dynamics in lakes, and we investigate properties of the analysis using simulation models. Results indicate that time-lag analysis provides a useful quantitative measurement of the rate and pattern of temporal dynamics in communities over time frames that are too short for more traditional autocorrelation approaches.},

  abstract = {A graphical equilibrium model, balancing immigration and extinction rates of species, has been developed which appears fully consistent with the fauna-area curves and the distance effect seen in land and freshwater bird faunas of the Indo-Australian islands. The establishment of the equilibrium condition allows the development of a more precise zoogeographic theory than hitherto possible. One new and non-obvious prediction can be made from the model which is immediately verifiable from existing data, that the number of species increases with area more rapidly on far islands than on near ones. Similarly, the number of species on large islands decreases with distance faster than does the number of species on small islands. As groups of islands pass from the unsaturated to saturated conditions, the variance-to-mean ratio should change from unity to about one-half. When the faunal buildup reaches 90% of the equilibrium number, the extinction rate in species/year should equal 2.303 times the variance divided by the time (in years) required to reach the 90% level. The implications of this relation are discussed with reference to the Krakatau faunas, where the buildup rate is known. A 'radiation zone,' in which the rate of intra-archipelagic exchange of autochthonous species approaches or exceeds extraarchipelagic immigration toward the outer limits of the taxon's range, is predicted as still another consequence of the equilibrium condition. This condition seems to be fulfilled by conventional information but cannot be rigorously tested with the existing data. Where faunas are at or near equilibrium, it should be possible to devise indirect estimates of the actual immigration and extinction rates, as well as of the times required to reach equilibrium. It should also be possible to estimate the mean dispersal distance of propagules overseas from the zoogeographic data. Mathematical models have been constructed to these ends and certain applications suggested. The main purpose of the paper is to express the criteria and implications of the equilibrium condition, without extending them for the present beyond the IndoAustralian bird faunas.},
