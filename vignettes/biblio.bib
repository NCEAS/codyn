abstract = {Stability in ecosystem function is an important but poorly understood phenomenon. Anthropogenic perturbations alter communities, but how they change stability and the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is not clear. We examined temporal stability (invariability) in aboveground productivity in replicated 18-year time series of experimentally perturbed grassland plant communities. We found that disturbed annual-dominated communities were more stable than undisturbed perennial communities, coincident with increases in the stabilizing effect of mean-variance scaling. We also found that nitrogen-fertilized communities maintained stability despite losses in species richness, probably because of increased compensatory dynamics and increased dominance by particularly stable dominant species. Among our communities, slight variation in diversity was not the strongest mechanism driving differences in stability. Instead, our study suggests that decreases in individual species variabilities and increases in the relative abundance of stable dominant species may help maintain stability in the functioning of ecosystems confronted with eutrophication, disturbance, and other global changes.},

  abstract = {{Summarizing complex temporal dynamics in communities is difficult
	to achieve in a way that yields an intuitive picture of change. Rank
	clocks and rank abundance statistics provide a graphical and analytical
	framework for displaying and quantifying community dynamics. We used
	rank clocks, in which the rank order abundance for each species is
	plotted over time in temporal clockwise direction, to display temporal
	changes in species abundances and richness. We used mean rank shift
	and proportional species persistence to quantify changes in community
	structure in long-term data sets from fertilized and control plots
	in a late successional old field, frequently and infrequently burned
	tallgrass prairie, and Chihuahuan desert grassland and shrubland
	communities. Rank clocks showed that relatively constant species
	richness masks considerable temporal dynamics in relative species
	abundances. In the old field, fertilized plots initially experienced
	high mean rank shifts that stabilized rapidly below that of unfertilized
	plots. Rank shifts were higher in infrequently burned vs. annually
	burned tallgrass prairie and in desert grassland compared to shrubland
	vegetation. Proportional persistence showed that and grasslands were
	more dynamic than mesic grasslands. We conclude that rank clocks
	and rank abundance statistics provide important insights into community
	dynamics that are often hidden by traditional univariate approaches.}},
