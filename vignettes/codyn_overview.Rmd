#Overview
As long-term datasets increase in scope and length, new analytical tools are developing to capture patterns of species interactions over time. `codyn` is a package that includes recently developed metrics of ecological community dynamics. Functions in `codyn` implement metrics that are explicitly temporal, and include the option to calculate them over multiple replicates. Functions fall into two categories: temporal diversity indices and community stability metrics. 

#Temporal Diversity Indices
Many traditional measure of community structure represent ‘snapshot in time’ whereas ecological communities are dynamic and many are experiencing directional change with time. The diversity indices in `codyn` are temporal analogs to traditional diversity indices such as richness and rank-abundance curves. 

- **`turnover`** calculates total turnover as well as the proportion of species that either appear or disappear between timepoints.

- **`mean_rank_shift`** quantifies relative changes in species rank abundances by taking the sum difference of species ranks in consecutive timepoints. 
This metric goes hand-in-hand "rank clocks," a useful visualization tool of shifts in species ranks. 

- **`rate_change`** analyzes differences in species composition between samples at increasing time lags. It reflects the rate of directional change in community composition.
