\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing time, species and abundance columns}

\item{time.var}{The name of the time column from df}

\item{species.var}{The name of the species column from df}

\item{abundance.var}{The name of the abundance column from df}

\item{metric}{The turnover metric to return; the default, total, returns summed appearances and disappearances relative to total species richness across both years
\itemize{
 \item{appearance: }{ returns the number of appearances in the second year relative to total species richness across both years }
  \item{disappearance: }{ returns the number of disappearances in the second year relative to the total species richness across both years }
  }}
