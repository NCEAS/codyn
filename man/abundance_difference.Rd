\usage{
abundance_difference(
  df,
  time.var = NULL,
  species.var,
  abundance.var,
  replicate.var,
  treatment.var = NULL,
  pool = FALSE,
  block.var = NULL,
  reference.treatment = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing a species, abundance, and replicate columns
and optional time, treatment, and block columns.}

\item{time.var}{The name of the optional time column.}

\item{species.var}{The name of the species column.}

\item{abundance.var}{The name of the abundance column.}

\item{replicate.var}{The name of the replicate column. Replicate identifiers
must be unique within the dataset and cannot be nested within treatments or
blocks.}

\item{treatment.var}{The name of the optional treatment column.}

\item{pool}{An argument to allow abundance values to be pooled within a
treatment. The default value is "FALSE", a value of "TRUE" averages
abundance of each species within a treatment at a given time point.}

\item{block.var}{The name of the optional block column.}

\item{reference.treatment}{The name of the optional treatment that all other
treatments will be compared to (e.g. only controls will be compared to all
other treatments). If not specified all pairwise treatment comparisons will
be made.}
}
\value{
The abundance_difference function returns a data frame with a subset
  of the following columns:
\itemize{
 \item{species.var: }{A column that has same name and type as the species.var
 column.}
 \item{difference: }{A numeric column of the abundance differences between
 the two samples being compared (replicates or treatments). A numeric column
 of the change in abundance between consecutive timepoints. A positive value
 occurs when a species has greater abundance in replicate.var2 than in
 replicate.var and/or in treatment.var2 than in treatment.var.}
 \item{replicate.var: }{A column that has same name and type as the
 replicate.var column, represents the first replicate being compared. Note, a
 replicate column will be returned only when pool = FALSE or block.var =
 NULL.}
 \item{replicate.var2: }{A column that has the same type as the replicate.var
 column, and is named replicate.var with a 2 appended to it, represents the
 second replicate being compared. Note, a replicate.var column will be
 returned only when pool = FALSE and block.var = NULL.}
 \item{time.var: }{A column that has the same name and type as the time.var
 column, if time.var is specified.}
 \item{treatment.var: }{A column that has same name and type as the
 treatment.var column, represents the first treatment being compared. A
 treatment.var column will be returned when pool = TRUE, block.var is
 specified, or treatment.var is specified.}
 \item{treatment.var2: }{A column that has the same type as the treatment.var
 column, and is named treatment.var with a 2 appended to it, represents the
 second treatment being compared. A treatment.var column will be returned
 when pool = TRUE, block.var is specified, or treatment.var is specified.}
 \item{block.var: }{A column that has same name and type as the block.var
 column, if block.var is specified.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the abundance difference for species between two
  samples. Differences are on abundance values provided, if relative data is
  used, then differences in relative abundance will be calculated. There are
  three ways differences can be calculated. 1) Between treatments within a
  block (note: block.var and treatment.var need to be specified). 2) Between
  treatments, pooling all replicates into a single species pool (note: pool =
  TRUE, treatment.var needs to be specified, and block.var = NULL). 3) All
  pairwise combinations between all replicates (note: block.var = NULL, pool
  = FALSE and specifying treatment.var is optional. If treatment.var is
  specified, the treatment that each replicate belongs to will also be listed
  in the output).
