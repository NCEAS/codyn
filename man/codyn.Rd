\title{Community Dynamics Metrics}
\description{
Temporal diversity indices and community stability metrics for ecologists.
}
\details{
The functions in \code{codyn} implement metrics that are explicitly temporal, and include the option to  calculate them over multiple replicates.
Functions fall into two categories: temporal diversity indices and community stability metrics.
The diversity indices in \code{codyn} are temporal analogs to traditional diversity indices such as richness and rank-abundance curves.
Specifically, \code{codyn} includes functions to calculate species turnover, mean rank shifts and lags in community similarity between time points.
The community stability metrics in \code{codyn} calculate overall stability and patterns of species covariance and synchrony over time.
Finally, \code{codyn} contains vignettes that describe methods and reproduce figures from published papers to help users contextualize and apply functions to their own data.

 \item{\code{\link[=rate_change]{rate_change}}}{: Calculates the rate change in a community over time}
 \item{\code{\link[=rate_change_interval]{rate_change_interval}}}{: Produces a data frame containing differences in species composition between samples at increasing time intervals}
 \item{\code{\link[=community_stability]{community_stability}}}{: Calculates community stability over time}
 \item{\code{\link[=variance_ratio]{variance_ratio}}}{: Computes the ratio of the variance of aggregate species abundances in a community }
 \item{\code{\link[=synchrony]{synchrony}}}{: Calculates the degree synchrony in species abundances}
