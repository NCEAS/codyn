Version 2.0.3
-------------

BUG FIXES

* Allow multivariate_ and abundance_difference to use `reference.treatment` with pooling.
* Eliminate superfluous treatment.var argument.
* Return NA for inconclusive multivariate_change and _difference results (see also vegandevs/vegan#306).

Version 2.0.2
-------------

BUG FIXES

* use codyn::Evar rather than codyn::EQ in RAC_difference
* fixes for breaking change in testthat (PR #111)

Version 2.0.1
-------------

DOCUMENTATION

* use `@inheritParams` to reduce redundancy

BUG FIXES

* elminate unverifiable centroid calculation in vegan::betadisper ([#306](https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan/issues/306))
* better error message (#108)
* fix handling of Null arguments (#95)

Version 2.0.0
-------------

NEW FUNCTIONS
