Version 1.0.0
-------------

NEW FEATURES

* Initial version (see help topic for 'codyn', e.g. "?codyn")
* Includes functions for temporal community dynamics analysis

NEW FUNCTIONS

* turnover: Calculates species turnover between time periods
* mean_rank_shift: Calculates the mean relative change in species rank abundances 
* rate_change: Calculates the rate change in a community over time
* rate_change_interval: Produces a data frame containing differences in species composition between samples at increasing time intervals
* community_stability: Calculates community stability over time
* variance_ratio: Computes the ratio of the variance of aggregate species abundances in a community
* synchrony: Calculates the degree synchrony in species abundances
* temporal_torus_translation: Calculates a null test statistic using a temporal modification of the torus translation
* temporal_torus_translation_CI: Returns confidence intervals calculated from a temporal modification of the torus translation
