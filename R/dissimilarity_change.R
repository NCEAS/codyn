#'@title Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of replicates between and within time periods
#' @description Calculates the average changes in Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of replicates between two consecutive time periods and within time periods. Between changes the average Bray-Curtis dissimilaritiy of all pairwise comparisions of replicates between two consecutive time periods. This is a measure of how dissimilar the community composition of two time periods is. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity ranges from 0-1, where 0 are identical communities, and 1 and completelty different communiites. Within change is derived in two steps. First, the average Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of all replicates within a time period is calculated. This is a measure of how homogenous a community is within a time step is. Then, these averages are compared between two consecutive time periods.
#' @param df A data frame containing time, species, abundance and replicate columns and an optional column of treatment
#' @param time.var The name of the time column 
#' @param species.var The name of the species column 
#' @param abundance.var The name of the abundance column 
#' @param replicate.var The name of the replicate column 
#' @param treatment.var the neame of the optional treatment column
#' @return The multivariate_change function returns a data frame with the following attributes:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{time.var: }{A characteric column that has the first of two time periods that are being compared.}
#'  \item{time.var2: }{A characteric column that has the second of two time periods that are being compared.}
#'  \item{BC_between_change: }{A numeric column that is the average pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of replicates in two consecutive time periods. 0 - The communities are similar over time. 1 - The communities are changing over time.}
#'  \item{BC_within_change: }{A numeric column that is change between two time periods in the average pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of replicates within a time period. A negative number indicates that time.var2 has varaiblity in community composition than time.var}
#'  \item{treatment.var: }{A column that has same name and type as the treatment.var column, if treatment.var is specified.}

# A function calculate the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity change between consequtive time periods and dispersion change (the difference in the average dispersion of the replicates around the centriod for the two consecutive time periods). For dispersion change a negative value indicates replicates are converging over time and a postive value indicates replicates are diverging over time.
