#'@title Bray curtis dissimilarity differences of replicates between and within treatments
#'@description Calculates the average difference in Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of replicates treatments and within treatments at a single point in time. Between treatment differences is the average Bray-Curtis dissimilaritiy of all pairwise comparisions of replicates between two treatments. This is a measure of how dissimilar the community composition of two treatments is. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity ranges from 0-1, where 0 are identical communities, and 1 and completelty different communiites. Within difference is derived in two steps. First, the average Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of all replicates within a treatment is calculated. This is a measure of how homogenous a community is within a treatment. Then, these averages are compared between two treatments.
#' @param df A data frame containing an optional time column, species, abundance and replicate, and treatment columns
#' @param time.var The name of the optional time column 
#' @param species.var The name of the species column 
#' @param abundance.var The name of the abundance column 
#' @param replicate.var The name of the replicate column 
#' @param treatment.var the name of the treatment column
#' @return The multivariate_difference function returns a data frame with the following attributes:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{treatment.var: }{A column that has same name and type as the treatment.var column, if treatment.var is specified.}
#'  \item{treatment.var2: }{A column that has the same type as the treatment.var column, and is named treatment.var with a 2 appended to it.}
#'  \item{BC_between_diff: }{A numeric column that is the average pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of replicates in two treatments. 0 - The communities of treatments are similar. 1 - The communities of treatments are very different.}
#'  \item{BC_within_diff: }{A numeric column that is difference between two treatments in the average pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of replicates within each treatment. A positive number indicates that treatment.var2 has varaiblity in community composition than treatment.var.}
#'  \item{time.var: }{A characteric column that has the same name and type as the time.var column, if specified.}
