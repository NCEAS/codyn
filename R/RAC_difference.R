#' @title Rank Abundance Curve Differences
#' 
#' @description Calculates differences between two samples for four comparable
#'   aspects of rank abundance curves (richness, evenness, rank, species
#'   composition). There are three ways differences can be calculated. 1)
#'   Between treatments within a block (note: block.var and treatment.var need
#'   to be specified). 2) Between treatments, pooling all replicates into a
#'   single species pool (note: pool = TRUE, treatment.var needs to be
#'   specified, and block.var will be NULL). 3) All pairwise combinations
#'   between all replicates (note: block.var = NULL, pool = FALSE and specifying
#'   treatment.var is optional. If treatment.var is specified, the treatment
#'   that each replicate belongs to will also be listed in the output).
#'   
#' @param df A data frame containing a species, abundance, and replicate columns
#'   and optional time, treatment, and block columns.
#' @param time.var The name of the optional time column.
#' @param species.var The name of the species column.
#' @param abundance.var The name of the abundance column.
#' @param replicate.var The name of the replicate column. Replicate identifiers
#'   must be unique within the dataset and cannot be nested within treatments or
#'   blocks.
#' @param treatment.var The name of the optional treatment column.
#' @param block.var The name of the optional block column.
#' @param pool An argument to allow abundance values to be pooled within a
#'   treatment. The default value is "FALSE", a value of "TRUE" averages
#'   abundance of each species within a treatment at a given time point.
#' @param reference.treatment The name of the optional treatment that all other
#'   treatments will be compared to (e.g. only controls will be compared to all
#'   other treatments). If not specified all pairwise treatment comparisons will
#'   be made.
#'   
#' @return The RAC_difference function returns a data frame with the following
#'   attributes:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{time.var: }{A column that has the same name and type as the time.var
#'  column, if time.var is specified.}
#'  \item{block.var: }{A column that has same name and type as the block.var
#'  column, if block.var is specified.}
#'  \item{replicate.var: }{A column that has same name and type as the
#'  replicate.var column, represents the first replicate being compared. Note, a
#'  replicate column will be returned only when pool is FALSE or block.var =
#'  NULL.}
#'  \item{replicate.var2: }{A column that has the same type as the replicate.var
#'  column, and is named replicate.var with a 2 appended to it, represents the
#'  second replicate being compared. Note, a replicate.var column will be
#'  returned only when pool is FALSE and block.var = NULL.}
#'  \item{treatment.var: }{A column that has the same name and type as the
#'  treatment.var column, represents the first treatment being compared. A
#'  treatment.var column will be returned when pool is TRUE or block.var is
#'  present, or treatment.var is specified.}
#'  \item{treatment.var2: }{A column that has the same type as the treatment.var
#'  column, and is named treatment.var with a 2 appended to it, represents the
#'  second treatment being compared. A treatment.var column will be returned
#'  when pool is TRUE or block.var is present, or treatment.var is specified.}
#'  \item{richness_diff: }{A numeric column that is the difference between the
#'  compared samples (treatments or replicates) in species richness divided by
#'  the total number of unique species in both samples. A positive value occurs
#'  when there is greater species richness in replicate.var2 than replicate.var
#'  or treatment.var2 than treatment.var.}
#'  \item{evenness_diff: }{A numeric column of the difference between the
#'  compared samples (treatments or replicates) in evenness (measured by Evar).
#'  A positive value occurs when there is greater evenness in replicate.var2
#'  than replicate.var or treatment.var2 than treatment.var.}
#'  \item{rank_diff: }{A numeric column of the absolute value of average
#'  difference between the compared samples (treatments or replicates) in
#'  species' ranks divided by the total number of unique species in both
#'  samples.Species that are not present in both samples are given the S+1 rank
#'  in the sample it is absent in, where S is the number of species in that
#'  sample.}
#'  \item{species_diff: }{A numeric column of the number of species that are
#'  different between the compared samples (treatments or replicates) divided by
#'  the total number of species in both samples. This is equivalent to the
#'  Jaccard Index.}
